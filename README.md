- Today's programming wisdom is to prioritize tasks, plan your time wisely, and stay organized. This will help you to be more efficient and productive in your coding endeavors.

First, prioritize your tasks. When you're working on a project, it' s important to determine which tasks are most critical to the success of the project. By focusing on these tasks first, you can ensure that your code is of high quality and meets the requirements of your project before moving on to less important tasks or bugs. You can use techniques like the MoSCoW method (Must have, Should have , Could have and Won't have) to categorize your task and prioritize them. 
 .Second, wisely plan time. Time management is crucial for any programmer. Use tools like Trello, Todoist or Google Calendar to plan and schedule your work. Allocate time for each task, taking into account its complexity and importance. Avoid multi-tasking as much as possible, as it can lead to decreased efficiency and increased stress. Instead, focus on one task at a time and give it your undivided attention. Finally, remember to take breaks and maintain a healthy work-life balance. It will not only improve your productivity but also help in preventing burnout.
