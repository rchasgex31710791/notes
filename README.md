- Today's programming wisdom is to prioritize tasks, plan your time wisely, and stay organized. This will help you to be more efficient and productive in your work. Here are some tips to help with this:

1. Break down large projects into smaller, manageable tasks.
2. Use task management tools, such as Trello or Asana, to keep track of your progress. These tools can help organize your tasks and set deadlines. 
3. Set priorities for each task based on its importance and deadline. Focus on the tasks with the highest priority first.  
4. Allocate time during your working day for specific tasks or time blocks. By scheduling time for certain tasks you are more likely to get them done.   
5. Learn to say no to additional tasks if you already have a full plate. It' s important to maintain focus on your current tasks instead of taking on more.    
6. Stay organized and tidy with your code and project files. Using version control, like Git, can also help keep your projects organized if they become large.     
7. Keep learning and improving your skills. Read blogs, watch tutorials, or attend workshops to stay up-to-date with new technologies and best practices.       
8. Don't be afraid to ask for help or advice from others. There is always someone willing to share their knowledge and experience.        
9. Take breaks throughout the day to clear your mind and recharge. A short break can lead to increased productivity and focus.
